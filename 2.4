# Create a list of all the cards in a 52 card deck
# Starting with one, keep doubling a number until it is at least a
# trillion (12 zeros) and how many iterations did it take?

# List of card in a deck
# Daimond, Spade, Club, Heart

# Make a list of the suits, then make a list of the numbers. Then use a for
# loop to join them both
